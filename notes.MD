# Encoder function

The self.encoder network is designed to output both the mean vector (μ) and the parameters for the covariance structure in a single forward pass. Let's look at how this works:
The key is in the final linear layer of the encoder network:

nn.Linear(hidden_dim // 8, 2 * latent_dim)  # 2 for mean and variance

This layer outputs a tensor with 2 * latent_dim dimensions, which is twice the size of the intended latent space. This is crucial because:

The first latent_dim values will represent the mean vector (μ)
The second latent_dim values will represent parameters used to compute the covariance matrix

The network doesn't inherently "understand" that half its output represents a mean and half represents variance parameters - this interpretation is imposed by how we use the network's output, not by any special structure within the network itself.
Let me explain:

The encoder neural network is just a function that maps inputs to a vector of size 2 * latent_dim
There's nothing special about the neurons in the final layer - they're all trained the same way through backpropagation
The interpretation of the output as "mean" and "variance parameters" happens in the encode() function:


# Reparameterization

The reparameterization trick allows the VAE to sample from the probabilistic encoder distribution while still permitting backpropagation. Without this trick, sampling operations would block gradient flow.

The method takes a multivariate normal distribution (created in the encode method) and uses the rsample() function rather than sample(). The "r" in rsample stands for "reparameterized."
Here's why this matters:

The VAE needs to sample from the latent distribution during training
Regular sampling operations aren't differentiable
The rsample() method uses the reparameterization trick, which expresses the random sample as a deterministic function of the distribution parameters plus some external noise

Specifically, instead of directly sampling from N(μ, σ²), it samples ε from N(0, 1) and then computes z = μ + σ * ε. This approach separates the stochastic component (ε) from the learnable parameters (μ and σ), allowing gradients to flow through μ and σ during backpropagation.
